Lily: So, how long has this been going on?
Barney: All summer.
Lily: I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.
Barney and Robin: Wow, wow...
Barney: Girlfriend?
Robin: Slow your roll there, Lilypad.
Barney: Yeah, yeah.
Lily: You've been together all summer. I don't get it.
Robin: Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.
**FLASHBACK**
Robin: We should figure out what this is.
Barney: Yes, we should. Or. Or...
They kiss again.
And after having s*x: 
Robin: Okay, now, we have to figure this out.
Barney: Yes, we do. Or. Or...
They kiss again.
**END OF FLASHBACK**
Robin: We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.
Barney: Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, ""I don't know.
It's not that I don't like you. It's just that I haven't had a girlfriend in a really long time. I hope it doesn't make you mad."" Who needs it?
Lily: You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.
Robin: Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.
Barney: Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.
Lily: No, no, no . You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.
Barney: Or. Or...
And he kisses Robin.

IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
Ted: I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?"" I know the board says ""Professor Mosby,"" but to you I'm Ted.
The blond girl raises her hand.
Ted: Question. Awesome. Hit it.
Blond Girl: Yeah, here's my question, ""Ted,"" who the hell do you think you are?
A boy: Yeah Ted, we're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect.
Another boy: And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip?
Ted: They're at home. I...
Another girl: And where are your pants?
Ted has no pants. Everybody in the class laughs.
Ted wakes, he's in his bed.
IN. TED'S ROOM
Ted: Oh, God.
Barney is in the room, looking for a condom.
Ted: Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...
Barney: Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?

IN. MC LAREN'S
Ted: I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.
Barney: Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.
Marshall: Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.
Lily: I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.
Barney: Exactly.
Lily: If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.
Barney: Amen.
Lily: You have to make things clear.
Barney: Run tell that.
Lily: Define the relationship.
Barney: Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.
They go a little further.
Barney: Lily, can't you just let us be happy?
Lily: You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.
Barney: And that's not happy?
Lily: Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.
Barney: Why? Give me one good reason.
Lily: I'll give you 20...
Barney: Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.
Brad:  I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...
Robin: Euh, oh, hum, heu...
Brad: What do I have to do? Put a gun to your head? Buy you a six pack?
He lifts his T-shirt.
Robin: Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.
Brad: Why not? You have a boyfriend?
Robin: No. No, no boyfriend.
Brad: Great! It's a date.
He turns to leave.
Brad: Hey Barn!
Barney: Hey Brad.
Lily: I just thought of a reason.

Ted : The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game.
OUT. HOCKEY GAME
Robin: You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.
**LILLTE FLASHBACK**
Robin: Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!
**END OF FLASHBACK**
Brad: Not really.
Robin: The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.
Brad: Oh, man. Is this the talk?
Robin: What?
Brad: No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.
Robin: No, Brad, no, it's...
Brad: But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.
Robin: God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.
Brad: You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...
Robin: Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says ""leap into it."" My brain says ""it's a bad idea.""
Brad: Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.

IN. TED'S APPARTMENT
Barney: We're not gonna have the talk.
Marshall: Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have s*x afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.
Ted: I don't think the talk is necessary.
Marshall: What?!
Barney: Thank you, Ted.
Ted: Because Robin is already his girlfriend.
Barney: What?!
Ted: MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...
** FLASHBACK MC LAREN'S BAR, 4 YEARS AGO**
Barney: How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.
Ted: ""Gremlins""?
Barney: Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them
during the day. And rule number 3, never feed them after midnight. Meaning she doesn't sleep over and you don't have breakfast with her ever.
Ted: What about brunch? Is brunch cool?
Barney: No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.
Ted: OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?
Barney: Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...
**END OF FLASHBACK**
Barney: I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?
Marshall: Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.




OUT. HOCKEY GAME
Voice: Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!
Robin and Brad are chosen by in the video cam.
Brad: Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.
Robin: Why not? Lay it on me.
They are about to kiss but Barney arrives and separates them.
Barney: Hey Brad!
He hits him but he hurts himself.
Barney: Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!
Brad: It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.
Barney: Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.
Robin: That's putting it a bit strongly.
Barney: A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.
Robin: A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?

IN. MC LAREN'S
Lily: Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?
Barney: Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.

Ted : Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make
a strong impression. I had thought of everything. Except...
IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
Ted is writing his name on the blackboard.
Ted:  Wait. Does professor have one ""F"" or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two ""F's"". That looks right. I think that's right.
He turns to see the students' reaction. A girl moves her head to say ""no"". So Ted transforms the F into E. Then he turns to see the girl, who says yes with her head.

IN. ROBIN'S ROOM
Barney: Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.
Robin: We've been over this. Unless I say ""flugelhorn"" you haven't gone too far.
Barney: No, I meant punching Brad.
Robin: Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...
She tries to open the door but it's locked.
Robin: God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?
Barney: No.
Robin: Flugelhorn. Did you do this?
Robin:  Ted, are you out there?
Lily:  Ted's not here, Robin.
Robin: Lily, let us out of here.
Lily: I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.
Robin: Lily! Come on. Let us out!
Lily: No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.
Barney: We are not having the talk!
Lily: Then you'll die in there.
Robin: You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having s*x!
Lily: Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.
Marshall: Hey, guys.

IN. TED'S CLASROOM
Ted : I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be...authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times.
Ted: Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.
The same blond girl raises her hand.
Barney appears as an angel.
Barney: Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here . Okay, good luck. Byesies.
And he disappears.
Ted : This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be. I had to decide.
Ted: Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...
Ted : Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken
that girl's question... who, by the way, was not your mom. Your mom was sitting... Wait, let me finish this real quick. Here's what that girl would have said.
Blond girl: I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom.
Ted : Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life.
Ted: Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.
A girl: Architect?

IN. ROBIN'S APPARTMENT
Robin and Barney are always looked in the room, while Lily and Marshall wait behind the door. Robin slips a note under the door.
Marshall: : We're just hanging out.""
Lily: Just hanging out? Not good enough.
Marshall:  Not good enough!

IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
Ted: Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?
A boy: Economics?
Everybody laughs.
Ted: Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.

IN. ROBIN'S APPARTMENT
Marshall:  ""We're seeing where things are going.""
Lily: I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.
Marshall:  Not good enough!

IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
Ted:  You... Why do you want to be an architect?
Student: I don't want to be an architect.
Ted: Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.
Everybody raise their hand.
Ted: No questions!

ROBIN'S APPARTMENT
Marshall:  ""We're Barnman and Robin.""  Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.
Lily: Not... good enough.
Marshall:  Not good enough!

IN. TED'S CLASSROOM
Ted: So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.
They are all about to leave.
Ted: Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!
Other professor:  Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats.
Ted: Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?
Professor: Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.
Ted: Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.
Student: T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.
Everybody laugh.
Ted runs to the right classroom.
Ted: Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.

IN. ROBIN AND TED'S APPARTMENT
Ted is back, he has told Lily and Marshall about his first day.
Lily: 20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.
Ted: Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.
Lily: That's awesome, Ted.
Marshall: Congratulations, buddy.
Ted: Thanks.
Robin:  Nice job, Ted.
Barney:  Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?
Ted:  Yeah, I got you, buddy.  They still haven't had the talk?
Marshall: I think I know how to speed things up
A few minutes later.
Robin: Not cool!
Marshall is using a ventilator to bring smells in their room.
Marshall: Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.
Robin:  Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.
Barney: Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?
Lily slips a note under the door.
Robin:  Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.
Barney: I know, right?
Robin: Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?
Barney: I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend
for a long time. I hope that doesn't make you mad.
Robin: Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clich√©, but... he really ruined me for other men.
Ted : Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine
Robin said something like that.
Barney: Maybe we should go back to being just friends.
Robin: Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having s*x.
Barney: Good. Me, neither.
Robin: Friends isn't gonna work.
Barney: We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?
Robin: I know something we're good at.
Barney: I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...
Robin: No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?
They slip a note under the door. Lily takes it and read.
Lily: Really?
Robin: Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.
Barney: And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.
Robin: We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.
Barney: And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.
Robin: And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.
Barney: She can handle her Scotch.
Robin:  He's my boyfriend.
Barney: And she's my girlfriend.
Lily unlocks the door and hugs them.
Marshall:  Good enough!

OUT. STREET
Robin:  She bought it.
Barney: Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.
Robin: Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?
Barney: You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.
Robin: Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.
Barney: Flugelhorn?
Robin:  Yeah, that felt wrong.
Lily, Marshall and Robin watch them going away holding hands.
Ted: You do realize they were lying, right?
Lily: No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.

IN. MC LAREN's
Marshall is coming, wearing a suit.
Marshall: Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.
He sits next to Barney and Ted.
Marshall: What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?

Barney: Guess who just got four tickets to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" Star Wars exhibit?
Lily: Why?
Barney: No, I said, ""Guess who?""
Lily:  I heard you.
Robin: Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?
Marshall: What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?
Barney: Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?
IN. TAXI
Marshall has accepted to go with Barney and they took a taxi.
Marshall: Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.
Barney: We're not going to the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.
Marshall: Where are you taking me, Barney?
Ted : This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us.
**FLASHBACK 4 YEARS EARLIER**

Ted: Wait a second, the ""Origins of Chewbacca"" exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?
Barney: My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.
Ted: Stop the cab.

Marshall: Where are you taking me?
IN. STRIP CLUB
Marshall: Barney, why are we here?
Barney: Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.
Marshall: Thanks, man.
Barney: You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.
Marshall: Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?
Barney: Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.

Ted : Meanwhile, Jen and I were at my favourite first date restaurant... for the second time.
IN. RESTAURANT
Ted: So, Jen, what do you do?
Jen: I'm between jobs banking crisis.
**FLASHBACK 2002**
Jen: I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you?
Ted: I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.
** 2009**
Ted: I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.

IN. STRIP CLUB
A striper comes up to Marshall.
Marshall: Married!
Barney: What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.
Marshall: I do! It's just not that easy.
Barney: False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.
Marshall: Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.
**MARSHALL'S FANTASY**
Lily starts to hiccup. Marshall took her to the hospital.
Doctor:  Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.
Marshall : What?! How could this be?!
Doctor: Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.
6 months later, Lily is still in the hospital.
Lily: It's time, baby.
Marshall: I will never love again.
Lily: No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.
Then she dies.
At the funeral, the priest speaks.
Priest: And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.
And after an appropriate number of years, someone knocks at the door.
Delivery girl: Delivery for Marshall Eriksen.
Marshall:  This one's for you Lily.  Where do I sign?
**END OF FANTASY**
Marshall: And then watch out, because it is on!
Barney: That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.
Marshall: It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.
Barney: I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.
Voice: Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.
The striper looks like Lily.
Marsahll: Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?
Barney, excited, calls Ted on the phone.
Barney: Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!
Ted:  Yeah, I can't talk right now.
Barney: I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!
Marshall: Stop looking at her.
Ted: Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.
Barney: Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.
Marshall:  I'll kill you!

Ted:  Sorry about that.
Jen: So, any thoughts on food?
**2002**
Ted: Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?
Jen: I would love to share the oysters.
Ted:  Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.
Jen: Wow, that's bad.
Ted: That's why it's funny!
**2009**
Ted and Jen: We've been on this date before.
Ted: We've been on this exact blind date before.
Jen: In this exact same restaurant.
Ted: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.
Jen: Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.
Ted: Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.
Jen: They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.
Ted: Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.
Jen: Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?
Ted: Well, you've got your cats.
They chuckle.
Jen: This is insane.
Ted: Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?
Jen: Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... 
**2002**
Ted laughs, reading the menu.
Ted: Main Lobster. They spelled ""Maine"" without the ""e."" Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...
Jen: I get it, Ted.
**2009**
Jen: Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.
Ted: Huh. I had no idea.
Jen: Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?
Ted: That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.
**2002**
The waiter brings the check. Ted takes it and Jen don't even look at it.
**2009**
Ted ; Guys want to wave the girl off and, you know, look like a big shot.
Jen: Huh. I had no idea.
Ted: This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.
Jen: We really are. Okay, I'm in.
Ted: Great.
Jen: Where'd we go next?
Ted: I think we went to MacLaren's.
Jen: Okay.
They rise up.
Jen: Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?
**2002**
Jen: And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.
**2009**
Jen: Tone down the kitty talk. Check.
They leave the restaurant.

Lily: Oh!
Barney: Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.
Lily: So you went to a strip club?
Barney: Busted.
Lily: And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?
Marshall: Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...
Lily: Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.
Robin: So... Strip club.
Barney: Marshall made me go.




OUT. STREET
Ted: All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.
Jen: Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.
**2002**
Jen: It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?
Ted: Not really.
Jen: Really? I can't feel my fingers.
Ted: I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.
**2009**
Ted: I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.
**2002**
Jen: After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.
Ted: I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.

Jen: Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?
Ted: See? Why didn't you lead off with that?

IN. MC LAREN'S
Lily: Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.
Barney: See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.
Robin: I'm not cool with it.
Barney: Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.
Robin: It's disgusting.
Barney: Because it's harmless.
Robin: Did one of your whores tell you that?
Barney: And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.
Lily: Trouble? What trouble?
Marshall: It's, no, it's nothing.
Barney: Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.
Robin: No, we're not.
Marshall: Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.
Lily: You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?!
Marshall: Murder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.

Ted: Remember? 
Jen: Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.

Jen: Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.

first date of all time, but, uh, I'm glad we stuck it out.
Jen: Me, too.

Jen: Good night, Ted.

Jen: Hello?
Ted: Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.
Jen: Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.

Lily: All right, we got to fix this.

IN. STRIP CLUB
Lily: Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.

Lily: Bring out Stripper Lily!

Jen: The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.
Ted: No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what
would have happened?

Ted: And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.
Jen: Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.
Ted: Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?
Jen: Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.
Ted: Well... good luck out there, Jen.
Jen: You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.

Ted: Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?
Robin: Brutal.
Ted: Really? How?
Barney: It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.
Robin: And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.
IN. MARSHALL AND LILY'S HOME
Robin and Barney just arrived for the couples' night.
Lily: Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?
Marshall: In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!
IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Barney: And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.
Ted: Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?
Robin: Yeah, how'd you know?
Ted: Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.
IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S HOME
Lily: That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.
Marshall: You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.
Lily: That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.
Marshall: Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.
Lily: And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.
Marshall: Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.
Barney: Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.
Robin: P.S., not sitting great.
IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Barney: And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.
IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S HOME
Marshall is trying to run the egg timer.
Lily: What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?
Marshall: I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.
Lily: Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. : You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.
Lily and Marshall laugh.
IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Ted: Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.
Robin: Show him.
Barney: This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night.  It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.
**MARSHALL'S VIDEO**
Marshall sings while scrolling pictures of that evening.
Marshall : It was the best night ever laughter raining down like April showers oh, we talked for hours... best night ever...
Ted: oh, that's not good.
Marshall : Then we played charades. Lily made some creme brulee, lay-lay-lay-lay and now that we're best couple friends there's only one thing left to say... are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free? Are you free next Saturday? That's the 17th.are you free? Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day.
**END**
Barney: Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.
Ted: I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?
IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S APARTMENT
This is the end of the evening, Barney and Robin are about to leave.
Barney: I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.
Marshall: Oh.
Robin: Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.
Barney: Let's do it again, soon.
Robin: Yeah, we'll call you.
IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Ted: They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?
Robin: Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.
A girl go out from Ted's bathroom.
Girl: Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you.
She goes out of the apartment.
Ted: Right?
Robin: Who was that?
Ted: Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.
Barney: Uh, no, it doesn't.
Ted: Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.
Barney: Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?
Ted: Westchester. Why?
Barney:  You're the sexless innkeeper.
Robin: Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!
Ted: What the hell is ""the sexless innkeeper""?
Barney: Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?
Ted: Not really.
Barney: T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens.  The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...
Ted: Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?
Barney: Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, ""where do you live?""And she said, ""one block south."". I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you
Ted: Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?
Barney: Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says you're not interested in, nor probably even capable of, having s*x. And she thought, ""hey, free lodging.""
Ted: No way.
Barney: I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.
Robin: Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!
Robin and Barney laugh and clap their hands.




IN. MC LAREN'S
Lily: Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.
Robin: We have. Go on.
Lily: Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!
Robin: Wait, you guys were serious about that?
Marshall: Oh, we never joke about b&b's, especially at the height of syrup season.
Lily: Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.
Marshall: And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.
Barney: Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.
Lily: Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.
Marshall: Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.
Lily: What's going on?
Robin: Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.
Barney: Plus, the alien thing.
Lily: Come on,Marshall.
Marshall: Let's go.
Robin: No...Lily...
Marshall: You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.
Lily and Marshall leave.
Barney: I think they bought it.

IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S APARTMENT
They are both on the couch with a blanket, eating ice.
Marshall: I can't believe they broke up with us.
Lily: We're so lovable.
Marshall: No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.
Lily: I thought we did everything right.
Marshall: I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.
Lily: Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.
Ted : It was true.Marshall had become addicted to creating songs and photo montages documenting various mundane events. So for months, all of Marshall's friends and professional colleagues were getting e-mails like this...
IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Ted is watching videos in his computer. Every song in the videos is singing by Marshall and illustrated by photos of the event.
Marshall : ordered Chinese food today some moo shu pork sauce got away flipped the cushion, now everything's okay.
Another video.
Marshall: Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. 
Another video.
Marshall: Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...
IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S HOME
Lily: I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.
Marshall: If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.
Lily: Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.
Marshall: One thing?  One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?
Lily: You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!

IN. MC LAREN'S
Ted: Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.
Barney: Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?
Ted: Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.
Barney: To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?
Ted: Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.
Robin: You're right.
Ted: Thank you.
Robin: All that sexlessness has made you wise.
Ted: For god's sake!
He leaves.
Barney: Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.
Barney and Robin laugh.

Ted : But eventually, even Barney and Robin had to admit they owed Lily and Marshall an apology.
IN. LILY AND MARSHALL'S HOME
Lily opens the door.
Robin: Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.
Lily: Oh. I wish you had called.
Marshall:  I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!
They laugh.
Guy: Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!
Marshall: Oh!
Lily: Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.
Robin: Wait. We just want...
But Lily closes the door.

IN. MC LAREN'S
Marshall: Hey! Hey, guys.
Barney: Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.
Lily: Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.
Marshall: Yeah, sorry.
Robin: Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.
Barney: Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
Robin: Yeah.
Lily: Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.
Barney: Who the hell are these people?
Lily: They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie
Marshall: Mmm!
Lily: And Shea, well... She's...
Marshall: Shea...Shea is just...
They both laugh and sigh contentedly.
Lily: Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.
Robin: Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.
Marshall: Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two.  Ooh.
They both join their friends, letting Robin and Barney alone.
Robin: Pfft, who needs 'em?
Barney: Pfft. Not us.
They hear laughter and then show a sad face.

OUT. STREET
Barney and Robin are walking sadly in the street. We can hear a song: 
* Livin' alone, we think of all the friends we've known but when we dial the telephone, nobody's home *
They enter in a restaurant.
Robin: Hi. Two for dinner.
Woman: Just the two of you?
IN. ROBIN'S APARTMENT
They go home, and eat ice cream sadly on the sofa.
* All by ourselves, don't want to be all by ourselves anymore, all by ourselves... *
Barney: Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.
Robin: After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.
Ted comes in the apartment
Ted: Hey, guys.
They groan.
Ted: Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?
Barney: Maybe. But they're Armani.
Ted: Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?

IN. MARSHALL AND LILY'S HOME
Marshall, Lily and their two friends are playing Twister.
Marshall: Oh, yeah!
Girl: That was amazing, Lily!
Lily: I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, ""what?!""
Guy: You guys are the best.
Marshall: Oh, right back at you!
Someone knock at the door. Lily opens and there is just an egg timer. It dings. Lily and Marshall goes in the hall and find another egg timer. It dings. They continue until the building door. They open it and, outside, under the rain, there are Robin and Marshall who carry another egg timer.
Robin and Barney: Ding.
Marshall and Lily join them.
Robin: For charades.
Lily: How do we know you two won't hurt us again?
Robin: You don't.
Marshall: You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.
Barney: Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?
Lily: Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?
Marshall: I think we can change them.
Lily: Come here, you two.
They sob.
Barney: We'll never sleep on thegouda again.
* all by ourselves... *

IN. TED'S APARTMENT
Ted: Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?
Barney: No, not really.
Ted: 'twas the night before, I had hours to kill.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.
Barney: With quill?
Ted: Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said ""classy,"" but her eyes whispered ""sin."" She said, ""you're a teacher?"" I said, ""yes, indeed."" ""I must have you,"" she moaned.""I'm turned on by tweed."" With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.
Barney: No way. You made that up.
A girl appears from Ted's room.
Girl: Are you coming back bed, professor?
Barney: Whew!
Ted: God, I love being single.
Robin appears from her room.
Robin: Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?
Marshall:  What have I done?
