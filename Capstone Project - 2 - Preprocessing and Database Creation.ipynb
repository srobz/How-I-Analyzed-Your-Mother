    "The purpose of this project is to do a thorough exploratory data analysis of the characters and scripts of the TV show How I Met Your Mother, as well as create a model that can predict who said which line. The data is from the website https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=177 where there are nine pages containing the 208 episodes from nine seasons that the show ran.\n",

    "This is the second notebook for my Capstone Project. This notebook includes preprocessing of the text data to prepare it for exploring/modeling, as well as preparing the data for a SQL database so it is easier to explore in the next notebook. This is a short notebook and the rest of the EDA is not included here because some of the code takes a long time to run and I want to keep all of the EDA together and organized.\n",

Based on how the data was read into the DF in the previous notebook, there shouldn't be any issues other than removing the \"motions\" from the lines, aka everything in parentheses. Part of me wants to add a column and just push these motions into a new column so we can look at motions like high-fives (as we know, Barney loves to high-five), but this will certainly result in a majority of NaN entries as not every single line includes a motion. I guess it couldn't hurt to make the column for it anyway in case I want to use it, and if I don't then no harm and if I do then it's available and ready! It's been decided, thanks for following."
